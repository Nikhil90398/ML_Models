Linear regression is a commonly used technique for solving [regression problems](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-sklearn-logistic-regression/v/66#C6). In a linear regression model, the target is modeled as a linear combination (or weighted sum) of input features.

This is because it tries to fit the training data perfectly. \n","\n","Instead, we'll use Ridge Regression, a variant of linear regression that uses a technique called L2 regularization to introduce another loss term that forces the model to generalize better.
